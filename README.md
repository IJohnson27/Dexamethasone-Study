## Summary
The top enriched pathway was found to be **Extracellular Matrix Organization**. This pathway displayed the highest Gene Ratio in our analysis. The result indicates that Dexamethasone has a significant impact on the structure of smooth muscle cells, aligning with clinical knowledge regarding the effects that corticosteroids have on connective tissue.
